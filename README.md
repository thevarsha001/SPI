SPI is a communication interface used to send data between multiple devices. These devices are organized into a master and slave configuration, in which the master has control over the slaves and the slaves receive instruction from the master. The most common implementation of SPI consists of a configuration in which a single device is the master, and the remainder of the devices are slaves. SPI is a synchronous communication protocol that transmits and receives information simultaneously with high data transfer rates and is designed for board-level communication over short distances.There are four signals required to implement SPI communication,MOSI	Data: Master Out — Slave In ,MISO	Data: Master In — Slave Out,SCLK	Serial Clock, CS	Chip Select
